Grove Accelerometer ADXL 356
==============


## Noteï¼š
The annalog output of sensor is 0~1.8V,and the accuracy of the sensor is 5% of the full scale range.
But the ADC resolution of arduino UNO(or other board based on atmega 328) is 10 bit.and the power supply is 5V,So it will cause deviation when using adrino for adc conversion.  
If using other board which has the lower power voltage,or the higher adc resolution,the deviation value will be decresed.
